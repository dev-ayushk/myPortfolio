CLASSES

Why should we use class?

If you observe, you will see classes are used in most modern programming languages because they allow us to logically group our data and functions in a way that’s easy to reuse.

•	Here we use “methods and attributes” these terms a lot.
•	Method: A function that is associated with a class.

For example, we have to represent the employees of a company X for their application in python code:
       Here use case for a class comes because each individual is going to have specific attributes and method.
